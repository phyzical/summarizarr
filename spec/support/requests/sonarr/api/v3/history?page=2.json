When a chance encounter with a young guy at a bar convinces her she looks younger than she is, Liza tries to pass herself off as 26 – with the help of a makeover, courtesy of her best friend Maggie. Armed with new confidence, she lands a job as an assistant to the temperamental Diana and teams up with her new co-worker and twentysomething Kelsey to make it in the career of her dreams. Now she just has to make sure no one finds out the secret only she and Maggie share.",
