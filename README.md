# summarizarr

TODO:

* support sonarr
* support radarr
* support bazarr
* support lidarr
* support readarr
* support mymar
* support tdarr

* make all of the above possible to be toggled via env
* And an env for interval i.e last day

for generic arrs we should be able to:
* pull the history given the interval, memoize and group by seriesId
* pull all the keys after that for series info, this should be cachable as we will only use for pics and maybe title
* maybe also group by episodeId
* Given the eventType's we should be able to determine upgraded vs new ect.
